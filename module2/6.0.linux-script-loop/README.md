## Basic Script for Generating Multiplication Table

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. This project will help us practice using loops, handling user inpute, and applying conditional logic in Bash scripts.

## Project Description

Your script should promt the users to enter a number and then ask if they prefere to see a full multiplication table from 1 to 10 or a partial table within a special range. Based on the user's choice, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table.

## Project Requirements

- **User Inpute for Number:** The script must first ask the user to inpute a number for which the multiplication table will be generated

- **Choice of Table Range:** The script must then ask the user to choose between a full table (1-10) or a partial table. If they choose partial, it prompts them to enter the start and end values for the range.

- **Use of Loops:** Implement the logic to generate the multiplication table using loops. You mmay use either the list form or C-style for loop based on what's appropriate.

- **Conditional Logic:** Use conditional logic to handle the user's choice of table range. If the user selects partial, prompt them to enter the start and end values for the range.

- **Inpute Validation:** Implement input validation to ensure that the user enters valid values for the number and range. Provide appropriate error messages for invalid input.

- **Output:** The script should display the multiplication table in a clear and readable format.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to catch and display any errors that may occur during script execution.

- **Comments and Code Quality:** Your script should be well-commented, explaining the purpose of different sections and any important variables or logic used. Ensure the code is neatly formatted for easy readability.
