## Terminal commands:
1. pwd (print working directory) : print working directory
    ```bash

    ```
2. ls (list) : list files and folders/directories in a directory
    ```bash
    	ls
    ```
3. touch (touch) : create an empty file. eg
    ```bash
     	touch README.md
    ```
4. cat (concatenate) : display the contents of a file. eg
    ```bash
    cat README.md
    ```
5. clear (clear) or CTRL+L: clear the terminal screen
    ```bash
    clear
    ```
6. tail (tail) : display the last 10 lines of a file. eg
    ```bash
    tail README.md
    ```
7. head (head) : display the first 10 lines of a file. eg
    ```bash
    head README.md
    ```
8. which (which) : display the path of a command. eg
