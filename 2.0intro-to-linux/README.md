# 2.0 intro to Linux
# INTRODUCTION TO LINUX

In the dynamic landscape of technology, mastering the fundermentals is essential for anyobe aspiring to excel in the fields such as Devops, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, AI, Machine Learning, AI, and QA Testing. This project is designed to equip with a solid foundation in Linux, a crucial skillset for professionals in these domains. Understanding the tech from the basics lays the groundwork for success in various tech-centered careers.

## What is Linux?
Linus is a free, open-source operating system similar to windows or macOS, but it's more widely used for servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. It's know for it's stability, security, and customizability, allowing users to modify and distribute thier versions. Linus runs on a wide range of hardware/devices, from desktops and servers to mobile devices embedded systems, and powers much of the internet's infrastructure. It is supported by a global community of developers who contributes to its many distributions, each tailoerd for specific needs or preferences. Linux is the foundation of many popular operating systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian which are different distributions of Linux.

## Why Linux?

Linux is a popular choice for professionals in the fields of DevOps, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, AI, Machine Learning, AI, and QA Testing. It is a powerful and flexible operating system that is used by many of the world's largest companies, including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It is also a popular choice for individuals who want to learn about operating systems and how they work.

## Linux Distributions

Linux distributions, often referred to as `"distros"`, are different versions (flavours ) of the Linux operating system built by different companies or organizations using the Linux kernel. Each distro is tailored for specific needs or preferences. They offer differnt configurations, desktop environments, and package managers, and software repositories, and then they are branded. Some popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Debian.

## Popular Linux Distributions

### Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution that is based on Debian. It is known for its ease of use and its support for a wide range of hardware. It is also a popular choice for professionals in the fields of DevOps, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, AI, Machine Learning, AI, and QA Testing. It is the most popular Linux distribution and is used by many of the world's largest companies, including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It's an excelent choich for beginners and professionals alike.

### CentOS
CentOS is a popular Linux distribution that is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is favoured in enterprises and server environments.  due to it's stability and long-term support. It is essentially a free and open-source version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) which is another distro itself, but requires paid license for production use. System administrators oftern choose centors because it is free, reliable and robust.

### Fedora
Fedora is a popular Linux distribution that is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is known for its stability and its support for a wide range of hardware. It is also a popular choice for professionals in the fields of DevOps, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, AI, Machine Learning, AI, and QA Testing. It is the most popular Linux distribution and is used by many of the world's largest companies, including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It's an excelent choich for beginners and professionals alike.

## Instalation and Initial Setup (Configuration)

In this section, we will create a server in the clud, and gain access to it from our local environment. When we say "Local environment", we mean our computer which could be windows or mac operating system in most cases, or even linux itself.

The setup is as shown below:

![Setup](img/1.0-remote-connection.gif)

We will user *AWS* (Amazon Web Services) to create a server in the cloud. For now, do not worry about trying to learn AWS as that will be dealt with much later along the line.

Rught now, all that is needed is to have a *Linux* server in the cloud, and gain access to it from our local environment.

AWS can provide us with a free virual server called EC2 *(Elastic Compute Cloud)*.

### Let us create an EC2 instance, i.e., a remote linux server

You may watch the video below to ger yourself set up.

- [Connecting  to your EC2 instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxT6PNJts-s)

Or follow the guidline I provide below:

- i. Register a new AWS account following this Instruction.

- ii. sign in to your AWS account.

- iii.  on the top left select services and sercf for Elastic cloud compute (EC2).

- iv. From the
